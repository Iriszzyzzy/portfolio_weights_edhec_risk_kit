SOURCE: Some code used from Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning - EDHEC Business School - Coursera Course (edhec_risk_kit).

This code locates the point on the efficient frontier that is the Max Sharpe Ratio portfolio given a set of expected returns and a covariance matrix.

This code uses the above objective from the EDHEC Coursera Course and calculates the portfolio weights that returns the Max Sharpe Ratio. Based on the portfolio weights, the code will determine the amount of money to invest in each stock/mutual fund given an amount of money to invest in.
