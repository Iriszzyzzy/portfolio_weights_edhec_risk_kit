# Finding the Max Sharpe Ratio Portfolio Based on Given Stocks/Mutual Funds 

SOURCE: Some code used from Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning - EDHEC Business School - Coursera Course (edhec_risk_kit).

We've already seen that given a set of expected returns and a covariance matrix, we can plot the efficient frontier. In this section, we'll extend the code to locate the point on the efficient frontier that we are most interested in, which is the tangency portfolio or the Max Sharpe Ratio portfolio.

This code uses the above objective from the EDHEC Coursera Course and This code calculates the portfolio weights that returns the Max Sharpe Ratio. Based on the portfolio weights, the code will determine the amount of money to invest in each stock/mutual fund given an amount of money to invest in.
